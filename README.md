### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### PROFILE
I was born in Ukraine, living in Amsterdam. Being involved with electronic music production for 15 years I decided to learn coding since it is also about creation. In July 2022 I've passed the course of Full Stack Software Developer at Codaisseur Academy(Amsterdam) and looking forward to get position of Junior Software Developer to bring my creative and technical experience into life and to become a part of experienced team in order to learn new technologies and increase as developer. 

### CODAISSEUR
It was 11 weeks intensive learning and practicing where I've got basic knowledge in JavaScript and technical skills in such 
technologies as:

- REACT, REACT HOOKS, REDUX TOOLKIT, AXIOS, HTML, CSS;
- NODE, SEQUELIZE, EXPRESS, REST API;

Additional skills in TYPESCRIPT, REACT NATIVE, GRAPH-QL.

### CODING EXPERIENCE

#### TWEAK PEAK
Building interactive music app for creating and mixing audio loops (React.js, Redux Toolkit, Tone.js, Node.js, Sequelize, Axios, PostgreSQL). It is solo project with creative idea and styling, which includes sampler to mix audio loops in 3 different styles and drum machine to create your own drum loops. All sounds produced by myself. My app won the 2nd place in the web apps challenge at Codaisseur Academy and I am keeping on working on it to bring more ideas into life.
