### PROFILE
Ukrainian born, Netherlands based. Creative, calm and open-minded person passionated for coding, hiking and composing music. Being a self-educated music producer and having pretty wide background in electronic music production I decided to switch to coding, keeping music as a hobby.
A year ago I have joined Meditools team as full stack developer right after my graduation from Codaisseur Academy in Amsterdam and currently having some valuable coding experience I am open for a new challenge. A mix of tech and styling as well as variety of projects and tasks would be definitely the best combination for me.

### PRE-CODING EXPERIENCE
I am self-educated sound producer and composer. Music is my passion. Being involved to sound production for 15 years I realised that creating process is the most interesting thing for me and actually it is the reasons of choosing developer career since it is also about creation. I used to learn a huge amount of different proffesional software and synthesizers, always have been experimenting in order to find original sound and style. For the last 8 years I've composed and released about 7 music albums and about 15 compositions in collaboration with famous artists. My music have been supported by world known labels and my sound considered to be authentic one. Sometimes I have gigs throughout the world on weekends and I also get some royalties from music sales.
