### PROFILE
Originally hailing from Ukraine and now based in Netherlands since 2022. With two years of experience in web development under my belt, I'm eager to take on fresh challenges and join a talented team dedicated to crafting functional and responsive applications. While my passion lies in frontend development, I've cultivated a solid foundation in backend technologies, particularly in the realm of building robust APIs and deploying projects. This comprehensive understanding of both frontend and backend aspects allows me to architect end-to-end solutions that deliver exceptional user experiences while ensuring scalability and reliability under the hood. 
I thrive on the creative process, bringing technical and styling concepts to life with a blend of creativity and technical skill. Able to self-manage the production of high-end websites (both frontend and backend), work on complex projects as a part of a productive and proficient team as well as mentor juniors.
I'm excited to contribute my expertise, learn from the team, and continue my growth journey as either frontend or full stack developer. 
Let's build something incredible together!

### PRE-CODING EXPERIENCE
I am self-educated sound producer and composer. Music is my passion. Being involved to sound production for 15 years I realised that creating process is the most interesting thing for me and actually it is the reasons of choosing developer career since it is also about creation. I used to learn a huge amount of different proffesional software and synthesizers, always have been experimenting in order to find original sound and style. For the last 8 years I've composed and released about 7 music albums and about 15 compositions in collaboration with famous artists. My music have been supported by world known labels and my sound considered to be authentic one. Sometimes I have gigs throughout the world on weekends and I also get some royalties from music sales.
